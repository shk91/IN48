<h2> 1. About The Project </h2>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlanning personal finance and keeping track of spendings is a tedious task, and in the fast paced world none of us have spare time for logging into multiple websites for numerous accounts and keep track of endless statements.
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbspMyFin application aims to provide aggregated, consistent and holistic view of all your expenditures and incomes.This application intends to use data from multiple notifications (sms, emails) to track your transactions and set reminders for due dates. It will consolidate transaction data from all your bank accounts and credit cards, create one statement for all transactions which helps you to better plan your finances.

 <h2> 8. Future Enhancement </h2> <br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. Use of Natural Language Processing for better analysis of SMS/Email notifications.
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. Alongwith organizing financial data, we can integrate a planner where we pre set our expenditures for upcoming month and compare it with current spends/balance.
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. Expand scope to organizing not financial data too. We have plethora of notifications on our mobiles and desktops via chats, push notifications alongwith SMS/Emails. 
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4. We can use concept of scraping and organizing data for all alerts and use that data to plan and schedule tasks, create reminders and have a personal assistant.
